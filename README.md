# Godot-001
 
This is my first godot test project, intended for playing around in an atempt to learn the engine

## Steam C#
If you are using the steam version of Godot and want to use C# in you project. Do the following:
1. Go in your Steam folder -> Steamapps -> common -> Godot Engine and rename the .exe (Which should originally be "godot.windows.opt.tools.64". Just rename it to something else)
2. Download the Mono Version of Godot
3. Copy the .exe and the GodotSharp Folder in your GodotEngine folder located in your Steam path
4. Rename the "Godot_vx.x.x-stable_mono_win64.exe" to the original executeable name "godot.windows.opt.tools.64"
5. If you now start Godot as usual from Steam, you are executing the Mono Version of Godot, since Steam just seems to check for the name of the .exe
